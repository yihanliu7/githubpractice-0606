## Versioning Vocabulary

**Repo or repository** (n.) 
: A discrete project on GitHub that contains a set of files, a change history, and a set of contributors. (E.g. [this one](https://github.com/digbmc/dssf-syll))

**Fork** (v.)
: To copy a repo's files and version history to a new one with its own settings (preserves connection with original repo but doesn't interfere). 

**Clone** (v.)
: To download a local copy of a repo on GitHub with a tracked connection to the remote repo.

**Local** (adj.)
: On your computer.

**Remote** (adj.)
: On someone else's computer (aka 'the cloud').

**Branch** (n.)
: A version of a repository with its own history. Branches can be created for a unique set of changes and later *merged* with the main branch to avoid file conflicts.

**Commit** (n.)
: A discrete set of changes to a project that have been packaged and labeled.
